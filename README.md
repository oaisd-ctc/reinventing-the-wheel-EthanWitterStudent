Any C# programmer has likely become used to C#'s built in functions. So used to them as a matter afact that programmers can take it for granted. To avoid falling into
that trap, we remade many built in functions, so we could properly realize how they work. The result is this, a package brimming with helpful functions that already exist and really bad jokes (we are not responsible for any deaths from cringe caused by our code). If you yourself wish to know how these built in functions, or are just that bored, here is the package for you!

## Functions and Explanations
### String Functions

#### ToUpper
Captilizes an entire string

Ex."FUnnY PoOp" returns as "FUNNY POOP"

#### ToLower
Changes an entire string to lowercase

Ex."SUSS" returns as "suss"

#### Length
Provides the length of a given string as a number

Ex."Apple" returns int 5

#### Reverse
Reverses the order of a string

Ex."dog" returns as "god"

#### CountVowels
Provides the amount of vowels in a given string as a number

Ex."Baller" returns int 2

#### CountConsonants
Provides the amount of consonants in a given string as a number

Ex."Baller" returns int 4

#### HasLetter
Searches string s for string t, returning True if t is found in s, otherwise returns False

Ex.s = "Boxer", t = "Box" returns True

#### HasWord
Checks to see if a string has content

Ex."" returns False

#### ClodsireOverride
Replaces a string's content with "Clodsire"

Ex."I HAVEN'T EATEN IN 3 DAYS-" returns "Clodsire"

#### HasLetters
Checks to see if a string has content AND doesn't have numbers

Ex."69" returns False

#### IsSussy
Checks to see if a string is sussy baka

Ex."Among us trap remix" returns True


### Math Functions

#### Power
Multiplies a number by itself to a certain degree

Ex. 10^2 would return 100

#### Absolute Value
Finds the distance a number lays from 0

Ex. -23 would return 23

#### Root
Finds the square root (rounded to the nearest whole number) of a given number

Ex. 49 would return 7

#### Max
Finds the highest number of 2 given numbers

Ex. If the given inputs are 35 and 69, it would return 69

#### Min
Find the lowest number of 2 given numbers

Ex. If the given in puts are 5318008 and 420, it would return 420

#### Add
Do I really need to explain what addition is? What, I do? Wow, okay, it where you ADD 2 NUMBERS

Ex. 2+2=4, SEE, EASY TO UNDERSTAND

#### Subtract
Okay, subtrac- REAALY?! Fine, it SUBTRACTS 2 numbers, effectively removing 1 number from the other

Ex. Do I- fine, 5-1=4, surely there isn't any more dumb-

#### Multiply
OH OF COURSE THERE IS! Essentially you are adding one number to itself a certain number of times, determined by the second number together, or in other words, MULTIPLYING THE NUMBERS TOGETHER

Ex. 3*9=27, what's next, divi-

#### Division
I WAS JOKING! Fine, it the opposite of multiplying, you take one number out of another number until you can't anymore, basically doing DIVISION

Ex. 32/8=4

#### Area of a Rectangle/Square
Okay, basically just the multiply function, but renamed, but it works...

Ex. 14*4=56

#### Find Area of a Circle
You multiply a number by itself, and then by pi/π/3.1415... to find the area of a circle

Ex. If the given number is 2, you would have π2^2, which would return 12.56637...

#### Find Rectangular Prism/Cube Area
It multiplies 3 numbers together to find the total area of a cube/rectangular prism

Ex. 2*4*6=48

#### Negate
Multiplies a number by -1 to negate the number

Ex. 91 would return -91

### Array Functions

#### Average
Finds the average of an array

Ex.{2, 4, 6, 7, 1} would return 4

#### Max
Finds the largest number in an array

Ex.{2, 4, 6, 7, 1} would return 7

#### Min
Finds the smallest number in an array

Ex.{2, 4, 6, 7, 1} would return 1

#### SortAscending
Sorts the array's values from smallest to largest

Ex.{2, 4, 6, 7, 1} would return {1, 2, 4, 6, 7}

#### SortDescending
Sorts the array's values from largest to smallest

Ex.{2, 4, 6, 7, 1} would return {7, 6, 4, 2, 1}

#### Sum 
Finds the sum of every value in the array

Ex.{2, 4, 6, 7, 1} would return 20

#### Product
Finds the product of every value in the array

Ex.{2, 4, 6, 7, 1} would return 336

#### Reverse
Reverses the order of the arry

Ex.{2, 4, 6, 7, 1} would return {1, 7, 6, 4, 2}

#### Median
Finds the median of the array

Ex.{2, 4, 6, 7, 1} would return 4

#### Range
Finds the range of the array

Ex.{2, 4, 6, 7, 1} would return 6

#### Mode 
Finds the mode of the array

Ex.{2, 4, 6, 7, 1} would return {2, 4, 6, 7, 1}
