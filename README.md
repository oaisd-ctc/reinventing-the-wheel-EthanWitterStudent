Any C# programmer has likely become used to C#'s built in functions. So used to them as a matter afact that programmers can take it for granted. To avoid falling into
that trap, we remade many built in functions, so we could properly realize how they work. The result is this, a package brimming with helpful functions that already exist and really bad jokes (we are not responsible for any deaths from cringe caused by our code). If you yourself wish to know how these built in functions, or are just that bored, here is the package for you!
